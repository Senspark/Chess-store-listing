Chess is a board game played between two players. It is played on a chess board, which is a square-checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
At beginning of the game, each player controls sixteen pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks and 8 pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in 'check') and there is no way to remove or defend it from attack on the next move.
